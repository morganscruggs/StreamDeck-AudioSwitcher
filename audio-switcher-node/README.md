# Audio Switcher Plus (Node)

A Node/TypeScript rebuild of [the native C++ plugin](../audio-switcher-exe/) - see [the repo root README](../README.md) for how the two compare, and for the notes/thanks/license shared by both.

## Why this exists

The native build ships its own compiled executable (`sdaudioswitchplus.exe`). On Windows 11 with **Smart App Control** enabled, that unsigned, freshly-compiled, no-reputation exe can be blocked outright - the button shows up in Stream Deck, but the plugin process never actually starts. This build sidesteps that by never launching its own executable at all: it runs inside Stream Deck's own bundled, signed `node.exe`, the same way [the sibling Multi Volume Controller plugin](https://github.com/morgan-scruggs/Stream-Deck-Dial-Multi-Volume-Control) does.

## How device switching works

There's no public Node API for enumerating audio devices or changing the default one, so this shells out to Microsoft-signed `powershell.exe` and runs inline C# (via `Add-Type`) doing raw COM interop - see [`src/audio-device-bridge.ts`](src/audio-device-bridge.ts). The COM interfaces used (`IMMDeviceEnumerator` and the undocumented `IPolicyConfigVista`) are the exact same ones the native build uses via its vendored `audiodevicelib` dependency - same GUIDs, same vtable order, just called from a different host process. `src/audio-device-service.ts` polls this bridge on an interval to keep button state in sync, since there's no way to get a real-time OS callback the way the native build's `IMMNotificationClient` does.

**Trade-off:** every device switch and poll tick is a real `powershell.exe` process spawn (roughly half a second), so this build is noticeably less responsive than the native one. If that matters more to you than the Smart App Control issue, use [the exe build](../audio-switcher-exe/) instead.

## Feature parity

Same settings/behavior as the native build: input/output direction, default/communication/"all" role, fuzzy device matching for devices that get renumbered by Windows, and per-button custom icons/colors. Icons are pulled from [`../shared/AudioDevicesIcons/`](../shared/AudioDevicesIcons/) at build time (see `copy-shared-icons` in `rollup.config.mjs`) rather than kept as a separate copy.

## Building

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This compiles `src/plugin.ts` into `com.morgan-scruggs.audioswitcherplus-node.sdPlugin/bin/plugin.js` and, if `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins\` exists and isn't a symlink back to this folder, copies the whole built plugin folder there.

**After any code change, restart Stream Deck fully** rather than relying on `npx streamdeck restart <uuid>` - that command has been observed to silently report success without actually restarting the plugin process (e.g. after a Windows reboot), leaving you testing a stale build:

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "StreamDeck" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Elgato\StreamDeck\StreamDeck.exe"
```

## Status

Not yet packaged into a distributable `.streamDeckPlugin` file - both this and the native build currently only run installed directly in Stream Deck's Plugins folder (dev mode). `@elgato/cli` (already a dev dependency) supports `streamdeck pack` if/when that's needed.
